# Awesome Agent Services [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of services, APIs, and infrastructure built for AI agents — not humans.

Humans have Gmail, Chrome, Stripe, and Slack. Agents need their own.

**Not a list of agents. A list of services agents use.**

Looking for agents themselves? See [awesome-ai-agents](https://github.com/e2b-dev/awesome-ai-agents) (26k ⭐).
This list covers the **infrastructure layer** — services where the primary user is an AI agent, not a human clicking buttons.
